## What is Moveit?
Moveit is a project carried out during the Next Level Week by Rocketseat. This has the main purpose of promoting breaks during work. After completing a 25 minutes timer, it sends a notice to the user that they can now perform a random exercise. By completing this exercise, the user receives XP and increases their level.
